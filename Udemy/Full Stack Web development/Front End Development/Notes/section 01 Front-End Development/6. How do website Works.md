## Notes: 
Html is responsible for the Structure of the website. 
html is the builder of the websites like buttons, titles, etc,.


CSS are responsible to styling the website.
the painter and decorator of the website. 
So you could say that, yes, I have a button that I got from my HTML,
but that button I want it to be red and I want the text to be white
and I want the font of the text to be an Arial. That is all done using CSS code.


__JavaScript code.__
And this is the code that allows your website to actually do things or have
behavior. And if you were building a house,
you would have the electrician come in,
who would be able to connect the wires so that your light bulbs actually switch
on or somebody who comes in and does the plumbing so that your toilet can actually flush. And the JavaScript code does exactly that.
It allows your website to actually do things and have behavior.
