__44.the Box model of website styling__


We can add the boxes to the elements on the web page like how far way they should be from each other distance between text and the border, text four deminsions of the border like height, bottom, left and right.

##### padding:

we can place distance between the text and the border using the padding .

padding will add the distance between the text and the border as in the image.

we can also see how it will interact with the margin element when it is added.

#####  create two more divs :

##### applying border and padding to the top-container div

by doing this we are adding more space to the sides of the div that we have created here it may look like that the width and height didn't change but in reality the border  added additional 10px space outside the given height and width.

margin does not effect the height and width of the div 
it just adds space away from the element and pushes it away.

##### Here is the challenge:

try to change the previous divs that are ceated to look like the same way that are in this picture.

we can do it by adding the border to the red div of 20px solid and then we can then add the 10px solid border to the blue div.

then we will add the margin left to the red div and we will add 300px or the required  untill the tow boxes are toucing with each other like in the picture.

then how do we calculated is that we have to check the margin and then parssing , border , height and width together to get that number of the margin-left as: 300px.

and repeat the same approach to the blue div but add the border, margin value of red div and the align it untill the blue div touches the red div just like in the picture. 
```CSS
margin-left = " 540px";
```
