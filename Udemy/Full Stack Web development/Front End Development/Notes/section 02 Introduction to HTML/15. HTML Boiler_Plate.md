__15. HTML Boiler_Plate__

> this is boiler plate type of code which is saved and can be used again and again when ever we want. 
> if you type "__html__" and press enter then the emmet installed in the atom package will give us the following code.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

// this code is a bolier plate
```

Note :

I we go in further and then we then enter the code __"html:4t"__ and hit tab then we will get this code 

``` html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

> this html code belong to a html4 version and we are currently using HTML5 for the web development.

Now we will open our website in the chrome browser in order to do that first we will go to the code and add some title to the title tag in the html code.  
which is "Vinod Kumar Rodda Personal Website"

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en" dir="ltr">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Vinod Kumar Rodda Personal Site</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

```

## Html structure:

The html code starts with a html opening tag and html closing tag anything in-between is the HTML code.

The code consists of both head and body. 

### Head:
> Head holds the information about the webpage and tells the browser  how to handle the page.
> the head has a title tag  which specify what is the title of the particular document.

in order to open the html file then we can go directly to the html file in the file explorer and double click it to open or copy paste the path of the file in the browser to open the website.

### body








###### meta element in the html:

meta elements give the extra meta data associated to the html document.
we are telling the browser that when we open this file encode all the text in the file it using the UFT-8 encoding system.
``` html
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
There are also other attributes on different websites.  
``` html
<head>  
  <meta charset="UTF-8">  
  <meta name="description" content="Free Web tutorials">  
  <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">  
  <meta name="author" content="John Doe">  
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">  
</head>
```

They also give data to the search engines about the content of the website. 
The search engines crawl our website to find the meta tag for the what is our website is about and how to display it

all the [available characters](https://www.fileformat.info/info/charset/UTF-8/list.htm) used in the website to render is correctly.
