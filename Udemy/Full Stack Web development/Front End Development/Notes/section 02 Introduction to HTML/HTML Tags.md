- there are a number of heading tags available from h1, h2, h3 to h6 after that if you write h7 it will not accept 
- the text can get smaller and smaller as we go so from h1 to h6

- To add the space between the tags we use "br".
- we can also add the tags "br" between the heading tags to make a line break or make it appear on  completely different line.
