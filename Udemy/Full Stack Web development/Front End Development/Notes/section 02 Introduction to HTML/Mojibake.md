## **[Mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake#:~:text=Mojibake%20(Japanese%3A%20%E6%96%87%E5%AD%97%E5%8C%96%E3%81%91%3B,from%20a%20different%20writing%20system.)**

([Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_language "Japanese language"): 文字化け; IPA: [[mod͡ʑibake]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Japanese "Help:IPA/Japanese")) is the garbled text that is the result of text being decoded using an unintended [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding "Character encoding").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake#cite_note-ieee-1) The result is a systematic replacement of symbols with completely unrelated ones, often from a different [writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system "Writing system").

This display may include the generic [replacement character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character "Specials (Unicode block)") ("�") in places where the binary representation is considered invalid. A replacement can also involve multiple consecutive symbols, as viewed in one encoding, when the same binary code constitutes one symbol in the other encoding. This is either because of differing constant length encoding (as in Asian 16-bit encodings vs European 8-bit encodings), or the use of variable length encodings (notably [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8 "UTF-8") and [UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16 "UTF-16")).

#Mojibake :Character that are transformed 
it occurs because our browser is trying to render the using the using the wrong character set.

it also incudes the international symbols.  every single symbol is include in the Unicode Character Set.
