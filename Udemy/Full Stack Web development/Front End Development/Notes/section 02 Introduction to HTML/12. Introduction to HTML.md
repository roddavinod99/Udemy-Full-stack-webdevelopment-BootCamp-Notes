#### 12. Introduction to HTML

HTML:
- all the browsers have single purpose that to interpret the files like HTML files, CSS Files, JavaScript files  into the website that it should be displayed. 

``` HTML
<head> 
<title> Hello </title>
</head>

<body>
<h1> Hello World</h1>
</body>
```

the above html code says that our website should have a title Hello and in the boby it should be a heading "hello world"

> HTML is the foundation of all websites.

we can see websites created just using the HTML files but not the websites only with CSS and JavaScript.

**HTML = Hypertext Markup Language.**

 We can specify the layout and structure of our website by using HTML Tags.
