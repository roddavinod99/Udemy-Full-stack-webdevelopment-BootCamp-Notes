13.Anatomy of HTML Tags


When we write the HTML in this way:
```HTML
<h1> Hello World!</h1>
```

h1 is the opening tag and /h1 is closing tags. everything in-between is content.

<"br"> are self closing tags with break tag.

__<"hr"> tag:__  #horizontal_rule

the hr tags can be used to create the horizontal line above the below the text and image and etc., it is also a self closing tag  which doesn't need a closing tag

We can make the horizontal line ticker with the following trick.
``` html
<hr size="3" noshade> ==$0
```

>first part is HTML element where as size ="3" means that it is an #HTML_attribute.

> we want a horizontal rule size =3 is  what written in the code.
