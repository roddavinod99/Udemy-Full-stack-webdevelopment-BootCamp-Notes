__34, External CSS__


We are going to change our website which is going to use internal CSS to external CSS.

create a new folder called CSS.
in it create styles.css

then by using the tag link we will link the .CSS file to the website and the other pages.

we write link  in all the page an they will follow this link to style the page right after they read the title tag.
 >after the browser reads the "link" then the right after that the browser will go for the 
Style.css file to add the styles chosen by the website owner to apply it to the website.
