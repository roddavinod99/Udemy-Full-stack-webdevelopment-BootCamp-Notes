__33. Internal CSS__

in order to escape writing the CSS style for every attribute like for every  (<"hr">)

we will then used Internal CSS where we will then place the CSS Styles in the Header part of the HTML  Code.

we will the remove and place the body tag of back ground color to the 
style tag in the Header tag that we have created to make the Internal CSS work in our site

then we will repeat the process again with the horizontal rule tag "hr" to change all the horizontal rule tag all at once in the personal website.

##### Add dotted Horizontal rule to the Web page

To do that we can write this 
```HTML
<style>
        body {
          background-color: #82DBD8; ;
        }
        hr {
          border-color: #2F8F9D;
          border-style: none;
          border-top-style: dotted ;
          width: 5%;
          border-width: 5px;
        }
      </style>
```

We will now go to the Hader section of the webpage and then we will write the background color in the header section and remove it from the body tag and it remains the same 

no we will ad the tag STYLE

##### [style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/style)

```HTML
<style>
        body {
          background-color: #82DBD8; ;
        }
        hr {
          border-color: #2F8F9D;
          border-style: none;
          border-top-style: dotted ;
          width: 5%;
          border-width: 5px;
        }
      </style>
```

we then give the parameter as given above to the hr and then the Horizontal rule (<"hr">) will then change from a normal rule to a dotted one after that.

 We can apply this method only to websites that are small with 2-5 pages 
 because you need to copy page the code again and again to all the header tags of the HTML files in order for your website to look good and same in all the webpages.

but this becomes a problem if you have 100 pages or 200 pages of website where you need to go to every webpage and edit it which is a time consuming method. 
which is why we have the External CSS where we write it once to update the style in all the webpages.
