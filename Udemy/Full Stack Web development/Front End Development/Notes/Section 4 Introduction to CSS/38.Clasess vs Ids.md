__38.Clasess vs Ids__
##### class selector
we learned about the class selectors instead of tag selectors. 

It will give us more flexibility  and allow us too specify the styles that we wanted for individual image.

>use classes when you want to apply same style to a group of related items.

##### Id selector:
it is little bit different from the class selector but they have a similarity.

we can change the color of the font by simply utilizing the  id we allocated to the h1

but we need to also have to observe that the heading color changed to blue but we still have a h1 tag which says red in the same style.css file.

it is because of the ID we have assigned to the heading 
the Id will override the h1 tag in the css file causing it to consider the Id selector over the normal h1 tag selector.

this is happening because we are being specific to the browser.

we use Id to identify the elements which is why that are unique no two id are same or it will show it as an error. 

One Id specifically can only be on one page.

you can also assign Id to different things that are all going to behave the same way.

>Use Id to apply specific style to a single element on your web page.
