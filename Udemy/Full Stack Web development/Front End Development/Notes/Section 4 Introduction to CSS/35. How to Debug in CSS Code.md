We are debugging the CSS code in order to prevents from any error that may occur after the style of the Code is assigned. 

##### 1  first debugging problem :
```HTML

<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Angela's Personal Site</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
  </head>

  <body>
    <table cellspacing="20">
      <tr>
        <td><img src="images/angela.png" alt="angela profile picture"></td>
        <td><h1>Angela Yu</h1>

        <p>I am an iOS and Web Developer. I ❤️ coffee and brew my own beers.</p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <hr>
    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp</li>
      <li>The Complete Web Development Bootcamp</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <table cellspacing="10">
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Dates</th>
          <th>Work</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>2009-2010</td>
          <td>Researcher at The Institute of Cognitive Neurosciences</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2010-2013</td>
          <td>Lead Developer at Tempo App</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2013-2015</td>
          <td>Clinical Doctor at the National Health Service</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <hr>
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <table cellspacing="10">
      <tr>
        <td>iOS Development</td>
        <td>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Web Development</td>
        <td>⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Photography</td>
        <td>⭐️⭐️</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <hr>
    <a href="hobbies.html">My Hobbies</a>
    <a href="contact-me.html">Contact Me</a>
  </body>
</html>

```


##### solution of this problem is that 


Open the chrome browser you are using and load the index.html file and then go to the  three dots and then go to the developer  tools 

and a console is loaded on the chrome screen. 
![[Pasted image 20220617182421.png]]
or you can also use the method of right click on the page and select inspect to bring up the chrome developer tools.

and it will report an error in the console.

>Failed to load resources, FILE NO FOUND.  and it also tells you what file it is trying to find for. 
>what the error is that the styles.css has a forward slash in front of  css/styles.css directory and because of which the browser will try to find the file from the root of the directory which we don't have any access and causes problem to load the page.
>In order to correct the webpage the we will remove the forward slash in the directory and then we will be able to make the browser find the css file in the sub directory of the folder. After that hit save and refresh the page to correct it.

##### Answer:
when we refresh the page we will find that the colors of the webpage has been changed 

this is caused by the because of the priority taken by the browser when it loads a web page.

When we open the developer tools and go to the elements and the press on the body section and then when we 
we have a css file but then we have internal CSS in the head section and also in the body section causing the browser to give priority to the body section as it is the main body of the web page. 
![[Pasted image 20220617190114.png]]

If we remove the body style part and then the header style part then the web browser will then start to use the css file path given to style the page.

This describes the hierarchy of the three different ways of implementing CSS.
