##### table tag
then we will add the 
``` HTML 
<table> </table>
```


in order to create the table we can also create table rows and  the table data.  like cells.

##### table row tag
now add the table row table to add rows in table.

```html 
<tr> </tr> 
```

one " tr " tag can be only used for only one row we have to use another tr for another "tr" row 

#####  table data element
to represent the cells we are using "td" tag  table data element
